# Arlo.js
A library to interact with [Arlo](https://www.arlo.com/en-us/) systems written in Typescript

Lots of inspiration from [Arlo.py](https://github.com/jeffreydwalter/arlo)! I don't have to do nearly as much reverse enginerring thanks to them.

Documentation will be available on the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/easton36/arlo.js/wiki)
